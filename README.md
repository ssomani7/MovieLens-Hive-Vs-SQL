# Movie Lens Database
## Hive Vs SQL Implementation
[Reference Paper](https://github.com/ssomani7/MovieLens-Hive-Vs-SQL/blob/master/COEN380_ResearchPaper_Team1.pdf)

Mini project to implement Movie Lens Database's HIVE and SQL version.

[Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/)

Objective of this project is to compare the run time perfomances of SQL vs HIVE on a small dataset and how the query execution plan is built up in the background.

Also explained are the concepts of schema-on-read, “Push Predicate Down”, hash-join, indexing, tree structures, Hadoop & MapReduce working. 

## Learning point: Hive useful for huge analytical processing & SQL for transactional operations.
